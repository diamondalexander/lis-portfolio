## About

The intention of this assignment was to help students gain practical technical & project management skills in the development and curation of digital collections using Omeka.

### Key Takeaways

As the Metadata Architect for my team, I gained valuable experience in structuring metadata creation, developing standards for object description, and enhancing records with hyperlinks and copyright symbols. I also became more familiar with Omeka (and digital collections, in general) through this project and I was able to translate this experience into my work as part of the 2024 CollectionBuilder LIS Cohort.

### Final Result
