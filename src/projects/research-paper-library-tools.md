## About

This assignment was intended to support students in identifying and describing the types of tools and/or utilities most relevant to their chosen library setting.

## Key Takeaways

I selected academic libraries as my library setting and, wanting to learn more about electronic resources, I chose to dive into the history and use of EZProxy. This was a fascinating assignment because I learned about the origin of EZProxy and the incredible problem it solved at the time. I also gained a deeper understanding of what goes into the general management of electronic resources (e.g. proxy configuration, stanzas, vendor communication), as well as more modern alternatives to EZProxy such as OpenAthens and other SAML-SSO solutions.
