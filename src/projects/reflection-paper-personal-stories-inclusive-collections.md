## About

This assignment was an opportunity to develop a greater awareness of disability & neurodiversity-related topics through engagement with first-person or personal narratives by individuals who identify as part of either or both of these communities

## Key Takeaways

One of the most important takeaways for me from this assignment was the call for both individuals and society at large to move from just “checking a box” when it comes to accessibility to embracing a genuine ethic for inclusion. In this paper, I also reflect on topics such as the performance of disability, the need for authentic representation, and actions that I, as a future library professional, would take to normalize disability representation & inclusion in both library collections and physical library spaces.
