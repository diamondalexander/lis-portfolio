## About

As the final project for this course, this assignment was intended to serve as a culmination of the previous weeks’ learnings related to metadata schemas, encoding standards, controlled vocabularies, and linked data principles.

## Key Takeaways

I wanted to try something a little unconventional for this project so I chose to create a metadata application profile, and eventually namespace, for a makeup collection – specifically lip products. I learned an incredible amount of information about unique identifiers for commercial products, everything from UPCs to GS1 taxonomies and more, which opened my eyes to non-LIS applications for metadata and taxonomy activities. I also gained experience with writing RDF/XML records using OxygenXML and creating my own namespace to accommodate unique fields.

I used this project as an opportunity to review metadata profiles from other institutions, such as Carnegie Hall and UNLV, to gain deeper insight into how other librarians conceptualize metadata description, crosswalks, etc. If I could do this project again, with more time and the experience I’ve gained since, I would work to include many more URIs for my objects and try to incorporate Wikidata or the commercial data I found to improve my records from simple RDF records to linked data ones.
