## About

CollectionBuilder (CB) is an open-source website tool that combines modern web technologies with structured metadata to build digital exhibits & collections. From January to April 2024, I joined nine other LIS students from across North America to work closely with the CB team to develop CollectionBuilder-CSV digital exhibits and contribute our learnings to the CB documentation and community.

### Key Takeaways

Participating in this cohort greatly enriched my practical, technical knowledge of metadata management, static site generators, responsive web design, and GitHub & became a launchpad for me to learn more about web technologies. In fact, this portfolio is a static website I made using Eleventy & Bootstrap—which I felt comfortable building and deploying because of the hours of experience I gained by customizing my CollectionBuilder collection. Working with CollectionBuilder also enhanced my metadata management abilities.
