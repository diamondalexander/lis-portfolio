## About

The goal of this paper was to select an aspect of the archives field (i.e. archival principles, core functions, or archival history) to research and analyze using scholarly literature.

## Key Takeaways

Considering my interest in all things technical relating to LIS, I focused my research on the history and future of electronic finding aids. It was a previously unfamiliar genre to me so this paper allowed me to broaden my knowledge of the paper-to-digital history of finding aids, learn how archivists relate to them compared to researchers/users, and explore what research had been done on finding aid usability. My favorite part of this paper is the discussion of data visualizations in finding aids as a way to improve archival collection usability and help researchers make new connections. Electronic finding aids open so many possibilities when it comes to the presentation of information and I would love to further explore this subject in the future.
