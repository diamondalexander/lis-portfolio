## Work Experience

As a Librarian-in-Residence at the Library of Congress, I lead and collaborate on projects that help elevate the user experience for the millions of visitors and researchers that interact with the Library each year. Prior to pursuing an MLIS, I worked for several years as a Web and Product Designer for various nonprofits, technology startups, and corporations where I led web design, digital strategy, user experience design, and accessibility efforts. Some of my previous employers & contracts include KPMG, Results for America, District of Columbia Public Schools, CityBridge Education, Penguin Random House, and The Land Trust Alliance.

## Professional Goals & Interests

We are witnessing rapid shifts in the traditional structure of knowledge & information organizations, like libraries, due to widespread generative AI adoption, open publishing initiatives, and community-driven, open-source technology. My hope is to build a career that allows me to meaningfully contribute to the systems, tools, and policies that shape how people interact with the overwhelming world of data available at their fingertips, now and into the future.

Some of my professional interests include:

- usablity and accessibility
- open-source library technologies
- knowledge graphs and linked data
- metadata standards & taxonomies
- data visualization for library & archival collections
- information discovery
