## About Me

MLIS, June 2024
Specializing in Information Technology, Digital Libraries, and Archives/Records Management 
Whether Iâ€™m wrangling e-resources in LibGuides, crafting metadata application profiles, or designing digital exhibits, I love using technology to improve access & discovery for all users.

We are witnessing rapid shifts in the traditional structure of knowledge & information organizations, like libraries, due to widespread generative AI adoption, open publishing initiatives, and community-driven, open-source technology. My hope is to build a career that allows me to meaningfully contribute to the systems, tools, and policies that shape how people interact with the overwhelming world of data available at their fingertips, now and into the future.

Some of my professional interests include:

- usablity and accessibility
- open-source library technologies
- knowledge graphs and linked data
- metadata standards & taxonomies
- data visualization for library & archival collections
- information discovery

### Professional Experience
